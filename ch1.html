    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The SPA is designed as a conceptual exploration rather than a linear text. It starts with an introduction to the core thesis: understanding the Quran's Explicit verses requires understanding the Human Self. The user is then guided to two main interactive sections. The first is 'The Nature of the Self', which uses interactive modules for each of the five senses to let the user experience the author's parables and grasp the concept of the 'store of experience'. The second is 'The 7 Types of Explicit Verses', presented as a clickable grid. Selecting a type dynamically loads its detailed commentary and examples into a main content view. This non-linear, concept-first approach allows users to understand the author's framework before delving into the proofs, significantly improving comprehension and engagement over reading a static page. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        1. Report Info: Core concepts of Explicit vs. Implicit and the role of the Self. -> Goal: Inform & Orient. -> Viz/Presentation Method: Thematic sections with clear headings and introductory text. -> Interaction: Vertical scrolling and navigation links. -> Justification: Establishes the foundational argument of the chapter clearly for the user. -> Library/Method: HTML/CSS.
        2. Report Info: Parables of the five senses. -> Goal: Engage & Demonstrate. -> Viz/Presentation Method: Five interactive modules. -> Interaction: User clicks a button for a sense (e.g., "Experience Taste"), which reveals a text block with the corresponding parable and explanation. -> Justification: Transforms a passive reading exercise into an active thought experiment, reinforcing the author's central point about the Self's 'store' of feelings. -> Library/Method: Vanilla JS, HTML/CSS.
        3. Report Info: The 7 categories of Explicit verses. -> Goal: Organize & Allow Exploration. -> Viz/Presentation Method: A responsive grid of clickable cards. -> Interaction: Clicking a card dynamically renders the detailed content for that category in the main view area. -> Justification: Breaks down the dense text into user-selectable, manageable sections, promoting exploration without overwhelming the user. -> Library/Method: Vanilla JS, HTML/CSS.
        CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used.

                This chapter explores the distinction between "Explicit" and "Implicit" verses in the Quran. The author proposes that the key to this understanding lies not in traditional interpretation alone, but in a deep exploration of the "Human Self" and how it perceives reality through its senses and stored experiences. This application will guide you through this unique framework.

                    The author argues that our "Self" can only comprehend things it has previously experienced through its five senses. These experiences create a "storehouse" of feelings and images. Interact with the modules below to explore this concept through the author's parables. This "storehouse" is the foundation for understanding all explicit commands and narratives.

                parable: "If someone draws your attention to a roaming hen and says, 'Look at the hen. It is wandering with its chicks. They are five in all. How pretty and soft they are. Just like the tufts of silk.'",
                explanation: "On hearing this if you look within, you will see the images of the hen and its chicks either floating in mind or appearing on the screen of your chest. Your Self retrieves this image from its store of things it has seen before. This faculty continuously stores countless images, forming a vast visual library for your Self to draw upon."

                title: "The Faculty of Hearing",
                parable: "If someone shows a picture and asks, 'See and say whose picture is this?'",
                explanation: "The name of the thing, like 'cat' or 'dog', comes up. The Self matches the image to a stored sound (the name) it has heard before. This demonstrates that the Self stores and connects different sensory inputs."

            tasting: {
                title: "The Faculty of Tasting",
                parable: "If I say, 'Look at this boy. He is chewing a lemon. It is damn sour but he goes on chewing'.",
                explanation: "These statements will likely bring water to your mouth. This shows that on mentioning a taste, the Self brings up from its store the already stored feeling of that same taste and understands it by comparison. It doesn't need to taste the lemon again to know 'sour'."
            },
            smelling: {
                title: "The Faculty of Smelling",
                parable: "When the Self smells anything, like a rose or jasmine...",
                explanation: "It brings out from its store a previously smelt scent or odour, compares it, and then declares what it is. This knowledge comes from its vast internal library of smells, distinguishing the pleasant from the unpleasant, the sweet from the bitter."

            touching: {
                title: "The Faculty of Touching",
                parable: "If I say, 'Oh! How soft! Fingers are dipping deep in it'. Or if I say, 'Oh! How flabby!'",
                explanation: "These statements will make an extremely mild soothing sensation felt on the tips of your fingers. The Self recalls the feeling of 'softness' or 'flabbiness' from its stored tactile experiences. The author elaborates that this applies to internal feelings too, like a headache, or external ones, like the 'prick' of a thorn, whose countless variations are all stored in the Self."

                            <blockquote>'O ye people! Eat of what on earth is pure and permissible' (Baqarah: 168).</blockquote>
                            <p class="mt-2">The text explains that this command is explicit because the concepts of 'eating', 'earth', 'pure', and 'permissible' are understood through our direct experience. The commentary further details what is forbidden (dead meat, swine) and what is pure (things brought 'out' of the earth, like fruits and vegetables), grounding the divine command in tangible, worldly understanding.</p>

                            <blockquote>'Fight in the cause of Allah.' (Baqarah: 190).</blockquote>
                            <p class="mt-2">This is an explicit command because 'fighting' is a known physical action. The author suggests this command prompts a test of the Self: is it truly ready to sacrifice? This internal reckoning is a direct, felt experience.</p>

                            <blockquote>'Say 'If the last Home, with Allah, be for you specially and not for anyone else, then seek ye for death, if ye are sincere'.' (Baqarah: 94).</blockquote>
                            <p class="mt-2">The author uses a parable of a man inheriting a fortune to explain this. The desire to reach the fortune is intense and real. Similarly, a true believer's desire for Heaven should be just as palpable. The lack of this desire, a feeling the Self can recognize, exposes a lack of sincerity. This is an explicit test of an internal state.</p>

                            <h5 class="font-bold text-lg mb-1">On Unity</h5>
                            <blockquote>'And hold fast by the rope (covenant) of Allah all together and be not disunited'. (Aale-Imran: 103).</blockquote>
                            <p class="mt-2">This command triggers a debate between the 'Self' and 'Reason'. The Self argues for tribal and national identity, which are felt attachments. Reason points to the Quran's explicit call for a higher unity based on faith. The author then argues against the modern concept of democracy and majority rule, quoting verses like 'But most people are ungrateful' (Baqarah: 243) and 'But most people do not know' (A'araf: 187) to state that majority is not a symbol of truth in Islam. This internal conflict between cultural norms and divine command is a universally understood human experience, making the verse's core message explicit.</p>

                            <blockquote>'And say not of those who are slain in the way of Allah that they are dead. Nay, they are living, though ye perceive it not.' (Baqarah: 154).</blockquote>
                            <p class="mt-2">This is a direct prohibition of a specific speech act. The concepts of 'saying', 'slain', and 'dead' are from our direct experience. The verse explicitly commands us to refrain from an action, even if the reason ('they are living') is beyond our perception. The command itself is clear. The author notes the contradiction in some views that the Prophet (SLM) can be considered dead while martyrs are alive, forcing the reader to reconcile the explicit prohibition.</p>

                            <blockquote>'And don't walk on earth with haughtiness, because you can't rend the earth asunder nor can you reach mountains in height' (Israil: 37).</blockquote>
                            <p class="mt-2">The prohibition against 'haughtiness' is explicit because pride and humility are feelings and behaviors we experience and witness. The verse grounds this abstract prohibition with physical, understandable limitations: you cannot split the earth or outgrow mountains. This ties a moral rule to physical reality. The author adds that 'Reason' reminds the 'Self' that the Earth is our mother and origin, deserving of humility.</p>

                            <blockquote>'And do not eat up your property among yourselves by wrongful means, not use it as bait for the judges...' (Baqarah: 188).</blockquote>
                            <p class="mt-2">The author presents this prohibition and the 'Self's' excuse: 'these are democratic times... if everyone becomes honest... lawyers will become jobless.' 'Reason' counters by introducing the parable of the 'Divine Prescription': A doctor leaves a perfect cure (the Quran), but people get it by heart and pay it respect, yet never use it when the plague comes, and so they perish. This makes the prohibition against corruption vividly understandable as a choice between following the life-saving prescription or ignoring it to one's doom.</p>

                            <blockquote>'And be not like those who forgot God! so He made them forget their own selves; these are the transgressors!' (Hashr:19).</blockquote>
                            <p class="mt-2">Forgetting is a common mental experience. The verse explicitly forbids this act of forgetting in relation to God, linking it to a tangible consequence: forgetting one's own self. The author explains that this opens a vacuum for the Devil to enter and take control, making the prohibition a clear warning about an internal state with dire consequences.</p>

                            <blockquote>'And, O my people! Give full measure and weigh fairly, and defraud not people their things, and do not act corruptly in the land...' (Hud: 85).</blockquote>
                            <p class="mt-2">This narrative is explicit because it deals with understandable social and economic actions: weighing, measuring, and fraud. The consequences‚Äîa 'mighty blast' and an earthquake‚Äîare physical events. The story serves as a clear, historical example of cause and effect based on observable behaviors. The author asks: Are these just stories, or lessons? We see the same deeds today.</p>

                            <blockquote>'So they ham-strung (slew) the she-camel and revolted against their Lord's commandments...' (A'araf: 77).</blockquote>
                            <p class="mt-2">The story, while containing a miracle, is built on explicit actions: the people's demand, the prophet's warning, the act of killing the camel, and the subsequent physical destruction by earthquake and fire. The author uses this narrative to explain an aspect of the Self: its tendency to reject information that contradicts its inherited convictions, a feeling we can all understand. He argues this is why we can have conviction about a story but not our own death, even though we see it daily.</p>

                            <blockquote>'And indeed we tried before them the people of Pharaoh...' (Dukhan: 17)</blockquote>
                            <p class="mt-2">The author uses the Quranic narrative of Pharaoh to frame a modern story about the Czar of Russia. He narrates a detailed account of Russian political machinations in Iran pre-1911, culminating in the bombing of the Holy Shrine at Mashhad. He describes the aftermath: an attack by countless crows on the Russian flag, which was seen as a curse. An Indian Maharaja, upon hearing the news, is said to have declared, "I shall discard Islam if the Russian Govt. does not come to an end within three years." The author notes that the Czar's regime fell in 1917, and the Czar and his family were killed in disgrace. He presents this as a modern fulfillment of the principle seen in the narrative of Pharaoh: that arrogance and atrocity lead to divine retribution. The lesson is explicit: take heed from history, both ancient and recent.</p>

                            <p class="mt-2">This verse is explicit because it governs the simple, physical act of eating and the social context of doing so with family and friends. It addresses social barriers (rich/poor, able/disabled) and promotes unity through the common, understandable experience of sharing a meal.</p>

                            <p class="mt-2">The instruction is made explicit through concrete examples of behavior: the utterance 'Ugh', the act of chiding, and the use of generous words. These are observable actions and speech patterns that everyone understands, making the command clear and practical. The author stresses that violating this may cause other good deeds to be rejected.</p>

                            <p class="mt-2">This prohibition is explicit as suspicion and spying are known actions. It's made more vivid by linking backbiting to the powerful, repulsive physical image of eating a dead brother's flesh, a feeling the Self immediately understands and abhors.</p>

                            <p class="mt-2">Each element mentioned‚Äîsky, earth, night, day, ships, sea, water‚Äîis part of our direct physical experience. The verse asks us to reflect on what we already see and know, making its message grounded and explicit.

                             <p class="mt-2">The verse points to the common experience of striking a fire and the existence of trees. It prompts reflection on the origin of these familiar things. The author explains it could refer to burning wood or the natural friction of trees like bamboo creating fire‚Äîboth physical, understandable phenomena.</p>

                            <p class="mt-2">This is explicit because the 'love of desires' for family, wealth, and property is a fundamental, felt experience for almost everyone. The verse simply states a psychological truth that the Self readily recognizes as its own state.</p>

                             <p class="mt-2">This verse presents a clear and recognizable pattern of human behavior. The feelings of desperation in hardship and forgetfulness in comfort are common to the human experience, making the description explicit and relatable.

                             <p class="mt-2">This verse is explicit because it compares the abstract stages of life to the tangible, observable life cycle of rain-fed vegetation: it grows, pleases, withers, turns yellow, and breaks down.

                            <p class="mt-2">This is explicit in its claim: the core religion is one and the same. The verse lists prophets whose stories are known, making the reference historical and concrete. The core of this religion is then defined as the 'purification of the Self,' an internal process whose effects can be felt, not just the establishment of kingdoms.</p>

                             <p class="mt-2">These verses explicitly define 'faith' in terms of 'love' and 'fear'‚Äîemotions that are primary and powerful experiences for the Self.

                             <p class="mt-2">This verse explicitly states that true religion is aligned with the fundamental, unchangeable nature with which humans are created. The author argues this nature includes the innate urge to be "the best" and "the greatest," which is the core of the religious impulse.
